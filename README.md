Middle News
Get in the middle of the news, and you get it.
Coding Bootcamp HW17 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**Middle News** is a full stack news app built by Kyle Rosenmeyer. The app allows the user to compare realtime news between left and right leaning outlets on a range of topics, and comment on articles.

This app is useful to learn the principals of web scraping and implementing a document oriented database into a full stack app. 

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however
Kyle Rosenmeyer may be contacted through his website for help or questions
regarding the project.
